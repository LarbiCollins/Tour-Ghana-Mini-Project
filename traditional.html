                    <h2>Culture, Customs and Society.</h2>
                    <p>Along the Gulf of Guinea lies the beautiful West African country of Ghana. Its culture and traditions are rich and vibrant.The people of Ghana are warm and friendly. They are polite, open and trusting — even with strangers. In Ghanaian society, it is traditional to take life at a relaxed pace and view time as a series of events rather than a matter of hours or minutes.</p>

                    <h2>In the Ghanaian society, people are very important.</h2>
                    <p>Most Ghanaians consider “let’s get to business” conversation rude. It is custom for Ghanaians to exchange pleasantries and ask about family before beginning business. They greet one another, making extra effort to greet older people. With the men, handshakes almost always accompany greetings. <br> Ghana’s 24 million people include six major ethnic groups that break into more than 60 smaller ones. The six larger groups are the Akan (Ashanti and Fanti), the Ewe, the Ga-Adangbe, the Mole-Dagbani, the Guan and the Gruma.<br> Like most other African nations, Ghana has rich, traditional cultures that differ from one ethnic group to another. Along with different ethnic groups and cultures, 52 separate languages and hundreds of dialects are spoken in Ghana. The official language is English — a residual of British colonial rule, from which modern Ghana gained independence in 1957.</p>

                    <h2>In Ghana's culture, GREETINGS are important</h2>
                    <p>Whenever one passes a group of people, especiallythe elderly, it is expected to always greet them. To fail to greet is considered an insult, and not easily over-looked. Males are expected to greet with the right hands up towarrds their forehead and females with a little bow.</p>

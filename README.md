# Tour-Ghana-Mini-Project
The responsive tourist website dabbed "TOUR GHANA" built using HTML and CSS aims
to provide an optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes. The
website's layout and content adjust dynamically to ensure readability and usability. HTML
is used for structuring the content, while CSS is responsible for styling and layout. Media
queries are implemented to adapt the design for different devices, allowing elements to
resize, reposition, or hide as needed. This ensures that visitors can access information
about tourist destinations, activities, and more, regardless of whether they're using a
desktop, tablet, or smartphone
